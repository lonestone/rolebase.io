# Circle Member Entity

## Relationships

### Object Relationships

- `circle`: The circle this membership belongs to
- `member`: The member associated with this circle membership

## GraphQL Examples

### Get Members of a Specific Circle

```graphql
query GetCircleMembers($circleId: uuid!) {
  circle_member(
    where: { circleId: { _eq: $circleId }, archived: { _eq: false } }
  ) {
    id
    circle {
      id
      role {
        name
      }
    }
    member {
      id
      name
      description
    }
    avgMinPerWeek
    createdAt
  }
}
```

### Add Member to Circle

```graphql
mutation AddCircleMember {
  insert_circle_member_one(
    object: {
      circleId: "circle-id"
      memberId: "member-id"
      avgMinPerWeek: 1200
    }
  ) {
    id
    circle {
      id
      role {
        name
      }
    }
    member {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

### Update Circle Member

```graphql
mutation UpdateCircleMember {
  update_circle_member_by_pk(
    pk_columns: { id: "circle-member-id" }
    _set: { avgMinPerWeek: 1800, archived: true }
  ) {
    id
    avgMinPerWeek
    archived
  }
}
```

## Permissions

Circle member access is controlled based on the following rules:

- Members can be added to circles by:
  - Organization owners
  - Organization admins
  - Circle leaders
- A member cannot be added to a circle if they already have an active membership in that circle
- Members can view circle memberships in circles they belong to
- Organization admins and owners can view all circle memberships

## Notes

- Circle members contribute to the circle's capacity through their `avgMinPerWeek` allocation
- The `archived` flag allows for maintaining membership history while marking inactive memberships
- Circle membership affects access to circle resources like meetings, tasks, and decisions
- Members can belong to multiple circles with different time allocations
- Circle membership is used to determine participation in circle activities and governance
