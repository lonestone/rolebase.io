# Thread Activity Reaction Entity

## GraphQL Examples

### Query Activity Reactions

```graphql
query GetActivityReactions($activityId: uuid!) {
  thread_activity_reaction(
    where: { activityId: { _eq: $activityId } }
    order_by: { createdAt: asc }
  ) {
    id
    shortcode
    userId
    createdAt
  }
}
```

### Create Activity Reaction

```graphql
mutation CreateActivityReaction {
  insert_thread_activity_reaction_one(
    object: { activityId: "activity-id", userId: "user-id", shortcode: "üëç" }
  ) {
    id
    shortcode
    createdAt
  }
}
```

### Delete Activity Reaction

```graphql
mutation DeleteActivityReaction {
  delete_thread_activity_reaction_by_pk(id: "reaction-id") {
    id
    shortcode
  }
}
```

## Permissions

Reaction access is controlled based on thread and activity permissions:

- Thread participants can:
  - View reactions on activities in their threads
  - Add reactions to activities
  - Remove their own reactions
- Organization members can:
  - View reactions in non-private threads
  - Add reactions if they have thread access
- Admins and owners have full access to all reactions

## Notes

- Each member can add multiple different emoji reactions to an activity
- Duplicate emoji reactions from the same member are prevented
- Reactions are typically displayed as emoji counts per activity
- Common emoji reactions can be suggested in the UI
- Reactions provide a lightweight way to engage with thread content
- Reaction counts can indicate activity importance or consensus
- Emoji support depends on the client platform capabilities
- Reactions can be used for quick polls or sentiment tracking
