### Update an Organization

```graphql
mutation UpdateOrganization {
  update_org_by_pk(
    pk_columns: { id: "your-org-id" }
    _set: {
      name: "New Organization Name"
      shareMembers: true
      protectGovernance: true
    }
  ) {
    id
    name
    shareMembers
    protectGovernance

}

## Permissions

The organization entity has different access levels based on user roles:

- `Owner`: Full access to all organization settings and data
- `Admin`: Can manage most organization settings and data
- `Member`: Can view organization data based on sharing settings

## Notes

- The `slug` field must be unique across all organizations
- When `protectGovernance` is enabled, only specific roles can modify governance-related entities
- `shareMembers` and `shareOrg` control visibility of organization data to external users
- `defaultWorkedMinPerWeek` is used as the default value for new member work time allocations
