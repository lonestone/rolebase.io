# Role Entity

[Rolebase public API](../public-api.md)

The `role` entity represents a role within an organization in Rolebase. Roles define the purpose, domain, accountabilities, and other aspects of a position or function within the organization. Each circle is associated with a role that defines its purpose and responsibilities.

## GraphQL Examples

### Query Roles

```graphql
query GetRoles($orgId: uuid!) {
  role(where: { orgId: { _eq: $orgId } }) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

```graphql
query GetRole($id: uuid!) {
  role_by_pk(id: $id) {
    id
    name
    purpose
    domain
    accountabilities
    checklist
    indicators
    notes
  }
}
```

### Create a Role

```graphql
mutation CreateRole {
  insert_role_one(
    object: {
      orgId: "your-org-id"
      name: "Software Engineer"
      purpose: "Develop and maintain software applications"
      domain: "Application codebase and development tools"
      accountabilities: "Write clean code, Review PRs, Debug issues"
      checklist: "Daily code review, Weekly status updates"
      indicators: "Code quality metrics, Bug resolution time"
      notes: "Focus on maintainable and scalable code"

      defaultMinPerWeek: 2400
    }
  ) {
    id
    name
    purpose
  }
}
```

### Update a Role

```graphql
mutation UpdateRole {
  update_role_by_pk(
    pk_columns: { id: "role-id" }
    _set: {
      name: "Senior Software Engineer"
      accountabilities: "Lead development, Mentor team members, Architect solutions"
      defaultMinPerWeek: 3000
    }
  ) {
    id
    name
    accountabilities
    defaultMinPerWeek
  }
}
```

## Permissions

The role entity has different access levels based on user roles:

- `Owner`: Full access to all roles
- `Admin/Member`: Can create and modify non-base roles
- All members can view roles in their organization

## Notes

- Base roles (`base: true`) are fundamental to the organization and can only be modified by owners
- The `singleMember` flag indicates if the role should be assigned to only one person
- `parentLink` allows the role to be linked to parent circles for cross-functional work
- `defaultMinPerWeek` helps in workload planning and time allocation
- The combination of purpose, domain, and accountabilities defines the complete scope of the role
