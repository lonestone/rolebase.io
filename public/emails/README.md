# Emails

## Fonts

Fonts used in emails are included here as static files to be loaded in emails by `Layout.tsx`

## Icons

Icons we're using in emails are compiled in PNG at build time by `src/buildEmailsIcons.js` script.

This script contains the list of icons to include.

To test in dev mode, you can update icons with:

```
npm run prebuild
```
